Inheritance:
Key word: extends
+You can create a base class (i.e. Animal class) and you can add capabilities special to another case (i.e. Dog, Cat, Fish)
+You can override the methods created in base class and add new functionalities in it. 
+We can add specific methods in sub-classes.


Difference between Inheritance and Composition:

- Inheritance is a "IS-A Relationship" : Dog is an Animal (Animal is the super class and Dog is the sub-class)

- Composition is a "HAS-A Relationship" : Every computer has a motherboard, or a screen. 

Encapsulation:

- You can only access the fields, methods by member functions of that class
- All fields are created private and not accessible from the outside of the class
- Getter, setters and other methods created as public to access and manage the fields and data in the encapsulated class
- Data and implementation hiding is the biggest advantage of encapsulation
- We can decide if the data is read only or write only


- Multiple inheritance is applicable by implementing from multiple interfaces.
- A Dog class can extend Animal class and implements walk interface
- A Bird class can extend Animal class and implements walk and fly interfaces.
